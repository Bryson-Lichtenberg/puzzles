The Boggle Bot uses a trie dictionary and recursion to quickly find all the words on a 5x5 boggle board (Python).
The Eight Puzzle project scrambles then solves the eight tile puzzle (a 3x3 grid with 8 tiles that make a picture when arranged properly) using an A* search algorithm (C++).
The Evil Hangman project uses set math to make Hangman almost impossible to solve (Java).
The Spelling Corrector uses a trie dictionary to verify proper spelling, then suggests replacement words based on common mistakes (Java).
The Decoder also uses a trie dictionary to decode a secret message for a murder mystery dinner (Python).
